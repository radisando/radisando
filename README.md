📊 As a creative strategist, I turn complex data into valuable insights through storytelling and data visualization. Basically I make data understandable and impactful for the decision-makers – whether using engaging presentations, detailed reports, or dynamic dashboards.

🌍 My international career journey has cultivated in me a passion for multicultural environments. I thrive in settings where collaboration across cultures comes naturally. 

👥 Beyond work, you’ll often find me engaging in volunteering initiatives, such as sport events and now as a leader of a Tableau User Group in Berlin, in which we are building a local community passionate about data and visual analytics. I also enjoy editing travel and family videos or exploring different sports.
