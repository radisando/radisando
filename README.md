# Hi there, I'm Rafael 👋 
### ... a Data & BI Analyst, passionate about visual analytics!

---

### About me...
📊 As a creative strategist, I turn complex data into valuable insights through storytelling and data visualization. Basically I make data understandable and impactful for the decision-makers – whether using engaging presentations, detailed reports, or dynamic dashboards.

🤖 Alongside BI, I’m expanding into AI and Data Science, working on projects in Python, NLP, and predictive modeling to connect analytics with innovation.

🌍 Having worked across Germany, Mexico, and Hungary, I thrive in multicultural environments and bring strong communication skills in English, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. Beyond work, I lead the Berlin Tableau User Group, building a community passionate about data and AI, and I also volunteer at international sport events.

🚀 Currently I'm looking for my next Data / BI Analyst role, where I can apply my expertise in analytics and visualization, and turn insights into real business impact and growth.
